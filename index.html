            <p class="fixing">I have learned basic HTML CSS and I belive it is an improvement even thought the progress
                is
                little. I am
                certain if I stick to this and work hard I can unlock my long cherished dream.

                    as
                    well maintaining documentation and other code rules that a good developer should follo. It was not
                    100%
                    correc back then but got to learn many new things.</p>

                    3months period as well.Back then I mainly focused on learning basics and made few small websites
                    which
                    are actually of very beginner level.</p>
